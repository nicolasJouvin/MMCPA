## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have followed the recommandations:
* Updated description
* Removed the unnecessary license file
* changed the package name to MoMPCA (old name was MMPCA) because of conflicting name
  with a new package submitted in-between.

* local linux ubuntu 16.04 xenial, R 3.4.4
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), devel and release
* OS X xcode10.2 (on travis-ci), devel and release
